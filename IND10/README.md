        Yes

- If you could suggest three improvements to working with GitHub, what would they be?

        1. Github could be introduced in the beginning of the semester.
        2. Some introduction about the markdown language could be taught in class.

- What was missing and what would you would have eliminated if you could?

        An introduction to the markdown language was missing. I would not eliminate anything delivered in the course as being student of Computer System Technician course, I am required to know the basics of networking and subnetting which was covered in the first half and the basic knowledge of github which was delivered in the second half of the semester.
