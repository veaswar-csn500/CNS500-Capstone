Organizing information with tables

You can build tables to organize information in comments, issues, pull requests, and wikis.

## Creating a table
You can create tables with pipes | and hyphens -. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column. You must include a blank line before your table in order for it to correctly render.

| First Header  | SecondHeader |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Con tent Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
