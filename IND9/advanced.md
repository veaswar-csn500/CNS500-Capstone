# Writing and formatting on GitHub - Advanced Features

GitHub combines a syntax for formatting text called GitHub Flavored Markdown with a few unique writing features. Markdown is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text.We've added some custom functionality to create GitHub Flavored Markdown, used to format prose and code across our site.
